# Orders_Data_Analysis
Data Analytics Project using Kaggle API, Python, and SQL Server

• Utilized Kaggle API to download the ’Retail Orders’ dataset and conducted data cleaning in Pandas,
handling missing values, renaming columns, and creating calculated fields using Jupyter Notebook.

• Loaded cleaned data into SQL Server via SQLAlchemy, ensuring correct data types and effective use of
'replace' and 'append' operations.

• Conducted SQL queries to identify the sales and analyzed region-specific sales trends based on total sales.
